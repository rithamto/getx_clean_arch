## 0.1.0

*   **Aggressive Project Cleanup**:
    *   Automatically removes all boilerplate generated by `flutter_flavorizr` (`main_*.dart`, `flavors.dart`, `app.dart`, and the `pages/` directory).
    *   Ensures a 100% pure Clean Architecture structure without redundant Flavorizr files.
*   **Template Enforcement**:
    *   Forced overwriting for `app.dart` and `main.dart` to ensure the GetX/Clean Architecture templates are always applied, even if secondary tools attempt to create their own versions.

## 0.0.9

*   **Initialization Flow Optimization**:
    *   Reordered `init` command steps to ensure `flutter_flavorizr` runs after dependencies and Firebase placeholders are created, but before the custom Clean Architecture setup.
    *   This prevents Flavorizr from overwriting `main.dart` and `app.dart` with its own boilerplate.
    *   Added automatic deletion of the generated `lib/flavor.dart` file to maintain a clean project structure.
*   **Firebase Configuration**:
    *   `_createFirebaseConfig` now runs earlier to provide the necessary files (`google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`) required by Flavorizr for platform linking.

## 0.0.8

*   **Robust Route Registration**:
    *   `create:feature` now uses feature-specific imports to verify registration, preventing false positives from commented-out code in templates.
    *   Improved insertion logic using class markers (`abstract class Routes {`) for more reliable code generation.
    *   Changed route registration logs from `detail` to `success` for better visibility.
*   **Flavorizr Fixes**:
    *   Fixed "No terminal attached to stdout" error by adding the `-f` (force) flag to skip confirmation prompts.
    *   Upgraded `_runFlavorizr` to use `Process.start` for real-time output streaming and better user feedback.
*   **Template Cleanup**:
    *   Refactored `app_pages.dart` and `app_routes.dart` templates to be more minimal and less prone to registration conflicts.

## 0.0.7

*   **Router & GetX Integration**:
    *   `init` command now always adds the `get` dependency, fulfilling the requirement for state management even when using GoRouter.
    *   `create:feature` now automatically registers new features in `app_pages.dart` and `app_routes.dart` for both GetX and GoRouter.
*   **Enhanced Flavorizr setup**:
    *   Moved `flutter_flavorizr` to `dev_dependencies`.
    *   Automatically runs `flutter pub get` after appending flavorizr configuration to ensure the environment is ready.
    *   Uses non-interactive execution (`yes | dart run flutter_flavorizr`) to improve automation reliability.
    *   Improved error reporting and logging for flavorizr execution.
*   **Template Fixes**:
    *   Fixed GoRouter `app_pages.dart` template to correctly import `app_routes.dart` and removed redundant `Routes` class definition.

## 0.0.6

*   **Router Selection**:
    *   `init` command now supports `--router` (`-r`) option to choose between `getx` (default) and `go` (GoRouter).
    *   Added GoRouter templates: `app_routes.dart`, `app_pages.dart`, and `app.dart` with `MaterialApp.router`.
*   **Enhanced Dependencies**:
    *   `init` command now automatically adds `flutter_localizations` (SDK), `firebase_core`, and `google_fonts`.
    *   Router-specific dependency: `get` for GetX or `go_router` for GoRouter.
*   **Bug Fix**:
    *   Fixed path resolution issue when creating new projects - now uses absolute path to ensure all commands run correctly in the new project directory.

## 0.0.5

*   **Theme Generation**:
    *   `init` command now generates `lib/common/themes/` with `m_color.dart`, `m_text_theme.dart`, `m_theme.dart`.
    *   Includes complete light/dark theme configuration with Material 3 and GoogleFonts support.
*   **Firebase & Flavorizr Setup**:
    *   `init` command now creates `.firebase/dev/` and `.firebase/prod/` with `google-services.json` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` placeholders.
    *   Generates `lib/firebase_options.dart` with flavor-aware configuration.
    *   Automatically appends `flavorizr` configuration to `pubspec.yaml`.
    *   Runs `flutter pub run flutter_flavorizr` after setup.
*   **Cleanup**:
    *   Removed unused `lib/core/style` folder generation.

## 0.0.4

*   **App Entry Point Generation**:
    *   `init` command now generates `lib/app.dart` with `GetMaterialApp` configuration.
    *   `init` command now overwrites `lib/main.dart` with proper service initialization template.
    *   Supports automatic package name detection from `pubspec.yaml`.

## 0.0.3

*   **Router Support**:
    *   `init` command now generates `lib/routes` with `app_routes.dart` and `app_pages.dart`.
    *   `create:feature` automatically registers new pages and routes in the Router files.

## 0.0.2

*   **Enhanced Init Command**:
    *   Added support for creating a new Flutter project from scratch: `getxcli init <project_name>`.
    *   Automatically adds `get`, `dio`, `flutter_flavorizr` dependencies.
    *   Configures Clean Architecture structure in the new project.

## 0.0.1

*   **Initial Release**:
    *   **Project Scaffolding**: `init` command to setup Clean Architecture structure (Core, DI, Theme).
    *   **Feature Generation**: `create:feature` command to generate Modules (Bindings, Controllers, Pages, Models, Widgets).
    *   **Asset Management**: `generate:assets` command to scan and generate type-safe asset constants.
    *   **Utilities**:
        *   `refresh`: Shortcut for `flutter clean && flutter pub get`.
        *   `git:branch`: Shortcut for creating new git branches.
        *   `run:flavor`: Shortcut for running specific environment flavors.
    *   **Router Support**: Integrated with GetX router.
